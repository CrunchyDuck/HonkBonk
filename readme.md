# Honk Bonk

HonkBonk is a collection of Discord bots that run various useful or fun commands.
He's primarily used for my entertainment and education.

### Setup
HonkBonk will require you to have at least Python 3.7.3 installed on your system (The lowest version I've tested it on.)

Download the pip modules required for this bot found in requirements.txt. if you're unsure how:
1. Open your console to the directory HonkBonk is in.
1. If you know how to set up a virtual environment, do that now (Skip otherwise) (`python3 venv venv` -> `venv\scripts\activate.bat`)
1. Type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

Download this github repository, then fill out the variables in example_settings.json. Look [here](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/#creating-an-application) for information on getting a Discord bot token and inviting your bot to a server.

With all of this done, you should be able to run HonkBonk.py with your Python interpreter!
